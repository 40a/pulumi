# lib/lumix

**NOTE:** This package is deprecated; please see lib/mantle for its replacement.

This is an experimental cross-platform library of stacks.

Please refer to the [Cross-Cloud Targeting](https://github.com/pulumi/lumi/blob/master/docs/x-cloud.md) design
document for more details on how this might work.

Note that everything in here very much a work in progress and little of it actually works (yet).
