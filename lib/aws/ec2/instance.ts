    // T2: Instances are Burstable Performance Instances that provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the
    // ability to burst above the baseline. The baseline performance and ability to burst are governed by CPU Credits.
    // Each T2 instance receives CPU Credits continuously at a set rate depending on the instance size.  T2 instances
    // accrue CPU Credits when they are idle, and use CPU credits when they are active.  T2 instances are a good choice
    // for workloads that donâ€™t use the full CPU often or consistently, but occasionally need to burst (e.g. web
    // servers, developer environments and databases). For more information see Burstable Performance Instances.
