        type: string
        description: The CIDR address block used for the destination match.  For example, `0.0.0.0/0`.  Routing

        description: The route table where the route will be added.
    # TODO(joe): the CF docs lump internetGateway and vpnGateway underneath the same gatewayId property.  And it is a
    #     requirement that you pass only one of gatewayId, instanceId, natGatewayId, networkInterfaceId, or
    #     vpcPeeringConnectionId.  Ideally we would leverage custom schema types for this.  In other words, we could
    #     have a "gateway" type that was either internetGateway or vpnGateway, and also required the attachment; then we
    #     could have a "routeTarget" type that was either a gateway or any of these other options.
