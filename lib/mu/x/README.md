# lib/mu/x

This is an experimental cross-platform library of stacks.

Please refer to the [Cross-Cloud Targeting](https://github.com/marapongo/mu/blob/master/docs/x-cloud.md) design document
for more details on how this might work.

Note that everything in here very much a work in progress and little of it actually works (yet).
