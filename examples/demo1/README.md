A simple Express voting app with a MongoDB backend, ready for production use.

It supports two web APIs:

1. GET /, prints out the current vote counts.
2. POST /vote, casts your vote for a particular candidate.

TODO(joe): it would be sooooo much better if we could demonstrate proper sharding and security for MongoDB.
