# sdk

The SDK directory contains language packages for the various supported languages.

These packages are real language packages and not MuPackages.  Therefore, they can contain I/O, asynchronous code, and
anything else necessary for building runtime code, resource providers, and other helpful Mu tooling and abstractions.
