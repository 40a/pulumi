## How is this different from ...?

# Helm Go Templates

# Google Deployment Manager (Jinja/Python)

# OpenStack Heat

* A real module and package management system.  (Terraform has a bit here; more template-like.)

* Built-in way to extend the system with "custom" resource types.

* No "interpolation": basic expressions, functions, conditionals, in an integrated language.
